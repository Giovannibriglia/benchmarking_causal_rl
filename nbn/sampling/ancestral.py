    """Batched ancestral sampler.

    Traverses the topological order once, sampling each node conditioned on
    its already-sampled parents.  Evidence nodes are clamped to their observed
    values; do-intervened nodes are clamped without contributing likelihood.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: NeuralBayesianNetwork
    n: number of samples.
    evidence:
        Dict mapping node name → tensor of shape ``[D]`` or ``[B, D]``.
        When provided, ``n`` samples are drawn and evidence rows are replicated.
    do:
        Do-intervention values.  A ``DeterministicMechanism`` replaces the
        node's CPD on its downstream path (mutilated graph).
    device:
        Override device.
    return_log_prob:
        If True, also return per-sample log-probabilities under the model.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
        One tensor per node with shape ``[n, D_x]`` (or ``[B, n, D_x]`` if
        evidence has batch dimension B).
