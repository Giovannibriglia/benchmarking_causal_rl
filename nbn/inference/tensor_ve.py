"""Log-domain einsum-based variable elimination for discrete BNs.

The v0.3.1 work introduces:

* A small per-model factor cache so repeated queries don't rebuild log-CPTs.
* A per-(targets, evidence_keys) plan cache so the elimination order is
  determined once.
* A *truly batched* ``query_batch`` that produces ``[B, K]`` from a single
  pass of the elimination procedure, rather than looping in Python over the
  batch dim.  Evidence is applied factor-by-factor via fancy indexing,
  introducing a leading B axis on every factor that touched any evidence
  variable; subsequent factor products and marginalisations broadcast over
  that B axis natively.

    # Keying a memo on ``id(model)`` alone has two failure modes, both of
    # which silently return *wrong numbers* rather than raising:
    #
    #   1. Refit.  ``model.fit(new_data)`` mutates the CPDs in place; the
    #      id is unchanged, so an engine held across the refit keeps serving
    #      the pre-fit posterior.  (``model.query`` happened to escape this
    #      because ``fit`` -> ``to()`` drops the model's own cached engine,
    #      but any externally-held or shared engine did not.)
    #   2. Address reuse.  CPython recycles ``id()`` values: a model that is
    #      garbage-collected can hand its address to an unrelated new model,
    #      which then inherits the dead model's factors.
    #
    # Storing a weakref alongside the entry fixes (2) — a recycled address
    # fails the identity check — and the model's ``_cache_version`` counter
    # (bumped by fit / update / set_mechanism) fixes (1).

        relevant set is a deterministic function of
