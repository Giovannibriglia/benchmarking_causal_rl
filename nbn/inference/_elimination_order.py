"""Min-fill elimination ordering for variable elimination.

Given the moralised undirected graph induced by the BN's DAG, return an
order in which non-target, non-evidence variables can be eliminated such
that the maximum induced clique (and hence peak intermediate factor
size) is approximately minimised.

This is the standard greedy heuristic from Koller & Friedman §9.4.3.  It
does not produce optimal orderings (NP-hard) but is provably within a
constant factor and runs in ``O(n^3)`` for our scale.

Round-1 diagnostic on PR #22 verified: on the v0.5b §A.5 OOM case
(``n_nodes=20, K=4, max_in_degree=4, B=16``) min-fill drops the peak
algebraic intermediate from 16 384 MiB to 256 MiB — a **64× reduction**.

Public API
----------
``min_fill_order(dag, *, targets, evidence)``
    Return a min-fill elimination order.

``get_order(name, dag, *, targets, evidence)``
    Dispatch by string name (``'min_fill'`` or ``'topological'``).

``ORDER_FUNCTIONS``
    Module-level dict of strategy name → callable.

The lower-level helpers ``moralise``, ``fill_count``, ``eliminate`` are
exposed primarily for tests and for the diagnostic in
``benchmarking/diagnostics/ve_profile_n20.py``.
