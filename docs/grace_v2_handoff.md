# GRACE v2 — handoff

Branch `feat/grace-v2` (off `feat/grace-critic`), worktree
`~/PycharmProjects/bcrl-grace-v2`, own venv with torch 2.10.0+cu130.

**Read this before touching anything.** The rules below were each learned by
getting them wrong, usually more than once. Rediscovering them costs a day
apiece.

## The standing rules

Each has a one-line reason. **A new statistic or component must argue against
these, not rediscover them.**

| # | rule | why |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | The declared **diagram is the only assumption**. Everything else is derived from it, learned, or named in the catalogue. | If a config can independently switch a channel on, the diagram stops being the assumption surface. `diagram_arms.py` derives *which* channels exist from the catalogue entry; YAML supplies only strengths, and a mismatch either way is refused. |
| **A2** | **No calibration constants.** No `k`, no `noise_ref`, no tuned tolerance, no discretisation in the estimator. | v1 died of them. Where a threshold seems needed, build a null from the data instead (see S1). |
| **S1** | **Nulls at EPISODE granularity**, never transition. | `U`, the proxies and the instrument are all episode-constant, so effective *n* is the episode count. Step-level resampling shatters the blocks and gives a null far too tight. Five instances: C1's splitter, L5's bootstrap, the k-rank permutation, and two preflight checks. |
| **S2** | Test the **conditional** claim, never its marginal shadow. | Marginals are nonzero *by design*: proxy⟂A reads +0.50 marginally vs +0.003 given `U`; proxy⟂S reads 0.226 marginally because `U→A→S`. And conditioning on *more* can be wrong — `A` is a **collider** on `I→A←U`, so conditioning on it alone opens `I→U→R`. |
| **S3** | A statistic must be compared against **a null that describes the statistic actually computed**. | A *maximum* over 8 tests judged by a per-test 3-SD cutoff runs ~8× the intended false-alarm rate — it fired on provably covariate-free proxies. Build the null of the max. Likewise a *binning failure* (Acrobot's reward is −1 almost everywhere) is not an uninformative view. |
| **S4** | Validate the **generator against ground truth**, and the estimator against the generator. Never mutually. | If each validated the other, a shared misconception passes in silence. Preflight reads logged `U` and declared parameters only — never L5, never the estimator. |
| **S5** | Validate on **real generated data**, not only a synthetic harness. | Three checks passed a synthetic harness and failed on the real generator: the harness's states carried no `U→A→S` path, so its marginals happened to equal its conditionals. |
| **S6** | **Identity has exactly one construction site**, and injectivity is unit-tested over the full grid. | Three V-B bugs in one session were all identity/collision. `dataset_name` omits the seed, so five seeds collided on one id and each run deleted the last — 27 report rows, 8 surviving datasets, silently. A helper-level test is not enough: an inline construction in `main()` collided while the test passed. |
| **S7** | Every long run asserts a **completion invariant**: surviving artifacts == report rows == expected grid. | "27 rows against 8 datasets" was a contradiction the driver could have noticed and did not; it ran 1h39m first. |
| **S8** | Report **"not testable"** as distinct from "passed". | D-E's exclusion had zero residual variance under the deterministic gate — a measurement of nothing that read as a clean pass. |
| **C3** | Estimates carry their conditions **on the object**. | `fit.estimate()` is the only way a number is produced, so none escapes without `monotone`/`converged`/`separability`. |

### Library rules (NBN v0.14.0, vendored)

| # | rule | why |
|---|---|---|
| **N1** | Targets and anything feeding a loss → **`sample(do=)`**, looped. Read-only quantities → **`query_batch(do=)`**. | The discriminator is **gradients**, not samples-vs-posterior. `query`/`query_batch` are non-differentiable by design; routing a target through them returns a value with no gradient and presents as a model that will not train. Say which you chose in the comment at each call site. |
| **N1a** | `sample(do=)` shapes: `do` values are **`[1, D]`** (not 0-d, not `(n,)`); evidence expanded to `n` rows. | A 0-d value fails *inside* the sampler. The batched-do axis is a *different* restriction and was **not** the cause of our failure — assuming it would have sent the fix the wrong way. |
| **N1b** | `query_batch` returns **`(weights [B,N], samples [B,N,D])`** for continuous targets, contradicting its annotation. | Posterior mean is the weighted average over particles. Reported upstream. |
| **N2** | `update_local` refuses weights → a refresh **refits**. | The EM M-step is inherently weighted. |
| **N3** | Weighted EM uses **MDN / flow / LinearGaussian**, never KDE. | KDE's bandwidth rule is unweighted, biasing strata toward each other — false negatives, the quiet direction. `supports_weights` is asserted per node so a mistake raises. |
| **N4** | Snapshot parameters with **`copy.deepcopy(state_dict())`**. | `state_dict()` aliases live parameters: `_bias` −0.012977 → **−0.017710 through the snapshot** after an in-place step. A backtrack written the natural way accepts every step it meant to reject, silently. |

## State by layer

| layer | state |
|---|---|
| **L1** declared diagram | **Done.** `cell_graph.py`, 9 entries. The entire assumption surface. |
| **L2** identification | **Done.** `identify.py`, derived from graph structure only (never reads `Verdict`, so gate V2 is a real test). Precedence: backdoor → frontdoor → proximal → instrument → lagged (gated) → **unknown ⇒ bounds-only, never point-ID by default**. |
| **arms** | **Done.** D-A-null / D-D / D-E / D-B′ generate, certify, and are byte-frozen against the historical arms. |
| **L3** estimation | **Core done, guarded.** `estimator.py`: EM over an episode-static latent, both channels, monotone-guarded GEM. |
| **L4** uncertainty | **Not started.** `interventional_sweep` is the seam. |
| **L5** falsification | **Not started.** The headline capability. |

### Open threads

* **V-B** running (`results/vb_generation/`, relaunched after the id fix). Its first run's 4 failures are **discarded** — computed on data later overwritten by the collision. Re-certification happens as part of generation, so no separate pass.
* **D-D's reward-view coupling** — documented in the catalogue, to be *quantified by R4*, deliberately not engineered away. Third-proxy remedy held in reserve, evidence-driven only.
* **C1's splitter assertion** attaches to V-D.
* **D-B's q2 stays gated** — degrades to bounds, does not serve point values.
* The **untestable-assumption section** in `diagram_catalogue.md` is the paper's limitations section in draft. A test enforces that a new untestable assumption cannot be added without appearing there.

### Gotchas that cost real time

* **pre-commit reformats and aborts the commit.** Always `git log` after committing; re-`git add -A` and re-commit.
* **One agent per worktree.** Kill by **PID**, never a bare pattern (`pkill -f regime_sweep` matches `test_regime_sweep.py`).
* The full test suite exceeds a 10-minute tool timeout; run in chunks with `-k`.
* Sampling from an **unfitted** model raises `assert self._bias is not None` — that is "sample before fit", unrelated to any do-semantics issue.
